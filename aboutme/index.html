    <h2>Luis Alberto Andrade Obeso</h2>
    <h2>Luis</h2>
    <p>Right now I started my career at BYU Applied Technology BS.</p>
    <p>I really like spending time with my family and playing with my children, Alejandro and Allison. Spend time at home with my wife Vanessa. With whom we have been married for 4 years and in May our anniversary will be number five. I currently work in the Barranquilla temple as a custodian. I started at Pathway to be able to strengthen my skills and be able to certify myself now if  I can get a better job and be able to give my family better opportunities. I have started this path with the support of my wife to obtain better income and better opportunities, what I love about BYU Idaho is that I can do it online while the children sleep and that helps me improve and develop my talents and skills, I hope I can I will improve my talents and thus develop more skills that allow me to improve my abilities and be an excellent web developer.</p>
    <p>I really like the quote that says: the Lord places his power in our efforts, I don't remember right now who mentioned it but I love repeating it to myself daily and seeking his guidance and help when I feel that I have given my best in all aspects. of my various responsibilities in life.</p>
    <p>I currently serve the ward that I attend as second counselor to the Bishop.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church of JesusChrist of latter days saint since 2004, 19 years ago I was baptized on January 11, I served as a missionary in 2011 in the Bolivia La Paz mission.</p>
