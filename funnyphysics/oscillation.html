                <p> or of stars that already died out millions of years ago and their light has just reached us due to the great distance they they are separated from us thousands of light years.</p>

                    <li>In its nucleus, constant nuclear reactions take place and they are the ones that produce the light and heat that we feel from our Planet.</li>
                    <li>Conditions in the core of the new Sun are more extreme: there is higher pressure and higher temperature (due to gravitational compression)</li>
                    <li>Although from Earth we perceive the Sun as yellow, the collection of gases, such as helium, hydrogen and other elements of which it is made, is so hot that it emits white light.</li>
