      Movement of Objects.
      <br><br> My website is aimed at the general public, especially young students.<br><br>
      <br><br> Where you will find mainly movements of objects in our environment.<br><br>
      <br><br> For which we will be able to appreciate the wonders of Physics that happen every day around us.<br><br>
      <br><br> And that we do not perceive because we pass by without noticing it.<br><br>

      <h3>Temperature Changes.</h3>
      <p>
        <p>My first page will touch on the subject of temperature change, which we can observe every day depending on the city in which we live, whether it is sunny, rainy, snowy, windy, among others, each day is a good reminder of being able to observe the different changes of temperatures that we have in our body, in the objects around us, or in the environment in which we work, study or carry out any activity.</p> 
        <p>From the moment we wake up, we take a hot or cold shower, eat food, move through the streets, arrive at the place where we work, we do not realize that the various temperature changes around us are affecting our daily lives and that they are important because we They affect our behavior or ability to face what happens to us, preparing us to be able to face the temperature that we have or face in the various places in which we may be.</p>

      <h3>Oscillation of Stars</h3>
      <p>My second page can remind us of the oscillation of stars in our sky, whether it is day or night.</p>
      <p>Where we will appreciate in the day those bright stars at sunrise or sunset, planets that shine with borrowed light. the dim colors of twilight or sunset. A good example would be the eight minute time it takes for sunlight to reach our position.</p>
      <p>Also at night the interesting gravitational lenses that show us a slight position of the stars which is moved due to the gravity of massive objects, or of stars that have already been extinct for millions of years and their light has just reached us due to the great distance that They are separated from us thousands of light years.</p>
